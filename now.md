I strive to be a well-rounded human. These are some of the things I am currently doing to achieve that goal.

## Increasing software quality

Most of my focus gets dedicated to my day job, where I work as a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer at [MPS](https://municipalparkingservices.com). My responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

- Onboarding and assisting engineers with navigating domain knowledge
- Designing, building, and maintaining our automation testing tooling
- Building internal tools/services to aid in testing efforts
- Thinking of ways to improve team/company processes
- Providing valuable feedback on products/services

## Tinkering with new tech

I am always looking for ways to sharpen my existing skills and acquire new ones. I've really been loving working with technologies like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org?ref=wiki.stamos.xyz), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org?ref=wiki.stamos.xyz) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com?ref=wiki.stamos.xyz) for building full-stack web applications and [SST](https://sst.dev?ref=wiki.stamos.xyz) for managing the infrastructure around that.

For backend, my go-to right now is [NestJS](https://nestjs.com?ref=wiki.stamos.xyz). I've been eager to start tinkering with [Golang](https://go.dev?ref=wiki.stamos.xyz).

For more information on my tech of choice, see my [radar](/radar).

## Working out

Fitness has become a huge part of my life recently, *and it will continue to be*. As passionate as I am about technology, music, and any of my personal interests, **none of it matters unless I am healthy**. Not only does this improve physical health/appearance, it also bleeds into mental and psychological health. Ever since I have prioritized going to the gym as a critical part of my daily routine, and it's made loads of difference in the way I think, feel, carry myself, and interact with others on a day-to-day basis. 

***I encourage everyone to take a little time out of their day to invest in their physical and mental well-being, whatever that looks like for you.***

## Reading

I enjoy reading books to help me relax. Most of the things I read about revolve around engineering/computer science, finance, and psychology.

## Mixing

I've been a big fan of house, dubstep, and electronic music in general for a while now. One of the things I enjoy doing in my free time is live mixing, also known as DJ-ing. I love learning and experimenting with new techniques and methods for meshing sounds together.
